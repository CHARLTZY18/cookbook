         <h2>Lumpia shanghai</h2>
         <img src="Lumpia Shanghai.jpg" alt="Lumpia Shanghai" width="500"> 
         <dl>Lumpia Shanghai is a smaller, meatier type of egg roll that we Filipinos are very proud of! You could use pork, beef, or both. It's a very easy and yummy recipe that's great as finger food. We serve these spring rolls with sweet and sour sauce, soy sauce with lemon, or banana ketchup.</dl> 
          <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <ul>
        <li>250g (9 oz) ground pork (or a mix of pork and shrimp)</li>
        <li>1 medium carrot, finely grated</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup green onions, chopped</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt/li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 cup flour (for binding)</li>
        <li>Lumpia wrappers (spring roll wrappers)</li>
        <li>Cooking oil (for frying)/li>

        </ol>
         <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Filling:

            In a large bowl, combine the ground pork, grated carrot, chopped onion, minced garlic, and green onions.
            Add the beaten egg, soy sauce, salt, pepper, and flour. Mix everything together until well combined.</li>
        <li>Wrap the Lumpia:

            Lay out a lumpia wrapper on a clean surface, with one corner facing you.
            Place a small spoonful of the filling near the corner closest to you.
            Fold the sides of the wrapper over the filling, then roll it up tightly from the bottom corner.
            Seal the edge of the wrapper with a bit of water or a dab of flour paste (flour mixed with a little water).</li>
        <li>Heat the Oil:

            Heat oil in a deep frying pan or skillet over medium heat. You’ll need enough oil to submerge the lumpia, but not too much to make it difficult to manage.</li>
        <li>Fry the Lumpia:

            Carefully slide the wrapped lumpia into the hot oil, a few at a time, without crowding the pan.
            Fry until golden brown and crispy, about 3-5 minutes, turning occasionally for even cooking.
            Remove the cooked lumpia and drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Serve:

            Serve hot with your favorite dipping sauce, like sweet and sour sauce or a simple vinegar-based sauce.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your crispy, homemade Lumpia Shanghai!</li>
